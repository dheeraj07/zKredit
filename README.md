# zkredit : Credit score verification app

Winner at Boston's renowned Web3 Hackathon: ETHBoston'23

## Problem Statement:

Cumbersome process of requesting your credit score from credit agency and sharing it separately with different lenders to get your loan/credit-card application approved. According to study by Intelligence Insider, every year 5.72 billion USD are lost in credit card application frauds. Key issues with existing system:

1. Over reliance on personal information
2. Data breaches (multiple SPOF)
3. Lack of control over personal information

Consequences:

1. Identity Theft
2. Discriminatory lending
3. Privacy Invasion
4. Fraud

## Solution: Zero Knowledge Proof based credit score verification

No personal information is shared at any point. Lenders are able to verify each and every data point they need for approval/credit limit decisioning. 

## Zero Knowledge Proofs

The purpose of zero-knowledge proofs is to convince someone you know something without revealing what that thing is. For example, you might want to convince someone that you know the solution to a puzzle without giving them the solution.
